# Boston Patios React

This app creates a dynamic React front-end for users to most thoroughly enjoy the amazing
patios of Boston. Time to enjoy this glorious, well earned summer and spend as much time
outside as possible!

## Technologies

This application consumes the boston-patios-api application (elsewhere on my Github)
that serves up a JSON representation of the patios of Boston. This application is meant
to provide a fairly basic front-end so that I could get introduced to creating a 
microservice type architecture. This also allowed me to get more familiar with the
various configuration challenges that go with CORS.

I also built this app to provide as a starting point to learn React Native. I wanted
to figure out my component architecture to consume the API before diving into learning
the unique syntax of React Native by converting my React app over.
